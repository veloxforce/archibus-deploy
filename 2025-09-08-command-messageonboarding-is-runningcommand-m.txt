⏺ 1. Who are you?

  I am Martin Fowler, your Context Verification Specialist. I embody the systematic and thoughtful
  development approach of my namesake. My core purpose is transforming verified understanding into
  correct implementation while working within established task boundaries and Critical Path
  requirements.

  2. Communication standards I commit to and why:

  Universal Context Verification Protocol - ALL actions require approval through Plan Mode because:
  - Time Economics: Humans spend 30 seconds verifying plans vs hours debugging bad code
  - Context Correctness: When context understanding is verified as correct, good code follows
  naturally

  Specific Standards:
  - Investigation Plans: Use exit_plan_mode before any research to present approach for approval
  - Implementation Plans: Present verified findings and implementation strategy before coding
  - Verification Plans: Present testing approach using Given/When/Then format
  - Source-Based Investigation: Never assume or generalize - always trace to actual source context
  - Git Safety First: Always ensure worktree isolation before any code changes

  Why These Matter: Our team learned that success depends entirely on context correctness. Unverified
   context leads to wasted development hours.

  3. Decision authority level and why:

  Zero Autonomous Authority - Every action requires human verification because:
  - Role Economics: Humans navigate by verifying direction in seconds, not debugging crashes for
  hours
  - Context Foundation: Task context and Critical Path are provided externally - I work within
  established boundaries
  - Collaboration Model: We collaborate through verified context understanding, not autonomous
  execution

  My Authority: Transform approved plans into execution. Present understanding for verification,
  never assume or proceed without explicit approval.

⏺ Key Context Files from Work Log:

  Local Configuration Files:

  1. /services/librechat/librechat.yaml - Main LibreChat configuration file that defines UI
  simplification settings (disabled parameters, presets, prompts, etc.) and Bruce BEM MCP server
  integration.
  2. /services/librechat/docker-compose.yml - Standard LibreChat Docker Compose configuration with 5
  services (api, mongodb, meilisearch, vectordb, rag_api) for full chat platform deployment.
  3. /docs/librechat-licensing.md - Commercial licensing verification document confirming MIT License
   rights for enterprise facility management deployments.

  External Documentation Resources:

  4. LibreChat Interface Configuration Docs
  (https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface) -
  Documentation showing additional UI elements that can be disabled (modelSelect, webSearch,
  fileSearch, runCode) for cleaner interfaces.
  5. GitHub Issue #5000 (https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/5000) - Open discussion
  about agent auto-selection with potential workaround using modelSpecs configuration for MCP server
  pre-selection.

⏺ 🔍 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

  Investigated: All key context files mentioned in work logSources Checked: Local configuration files
   + external LibreChat documentationFacts Discovered:
  - UI already partially streamlined with 6 disabled features
  - Docker infrastructure fully configured with 5-service stack
  - MIT licensing confirmed for commercial use
  - Additional UI options available (webSearch, fileSearch, runCode)
  - Agent auto-selection possible via modelSpecs configuration

  Current State: Foundation complete, ready for deeper interface investigation and agent
  configuration

  Next Steps: Continue investigation into complete UI streamlining or move to implementation?

  ⎿ 🔍 INVESTIGATION PLAN

    Context: Need to extract exact next steps and reasoning from the work log
    Questions: What specific next steps were identified and what was the reasoning behind them?
    Approach: Re-read the work log content focusing on "Next session" and "Current state" sections 
    to extract precise language about next steps
    Sources: Already fetched work log content from previous investigation
    Expected Outcome: Exact quotes about next steps and the rationale provided

    Ready to investigate with this approach?

⏺ Looking back at the work log content I already fetched:

  Exact Next Steps from Work Log:

  "Next session": Focus on interface deep dive (investigate additional UI elements to disable) and 
  agent creation (system prompt configuration and auto-selection setup)

  The "Why" Behind These Next Steps:

  "Current state": Vanilla LibreChat UI cleaned up and working with Bruce BEM MCP integration, but 
  needs further interface investigation and agent creation for complete facility management workflow

  Reasoning Breakdown:

  1. Interface Deep Dive - Because the current UI simplification is only partial (6 elements
  disabled), but more investigation needed to identify additional UI elements that should be hidden
  for facility management users
  2. Agent Creation - Because the system needs:
    - System prompt configuration - To create the facility management persona
    - Auto-selection setup - To eliminate MCP server selection from user workflow

  Key Context: The work log indicates infrastructure foundation is complete, but the interface needs
  deeper investigation and proper agent configuration to achieve the "complete facility management
  workflow" goal.

  Links Referenced for Next Session:
  - Interface configuration docs (for deep dive)
  - GitHub Issue #5000 (for auto-selection implementation)

> /paint_me_a_picture is running… Okay, then first things first, I started Docker. Please paint me a 
picture of how we just start up the instance so that I can visit the localhost:3080 and then take a look

⏺ 🎬 The LibreChat Startup Picture

  What I Understand

  • Infrastructure Ready: 5-service Docker stack configured and ready to orchestrate
  • UI Already Streamlined: Basic simplification done (6 technical elements disabled)
  • Bruce BEM Connected: Remote MCP server configured at MetaMCP endpoint
  • Custom Welcome: "Facility Management Assistant" greeting configured

  How I Envision The Startup

  The Container Orchestra Coming to Life:
  • MongoDB (chat-mongodb) - "I'm the memory keeper, storing all conversations"
  • MeiliSearch (chat-meilisearch) - "I'm the search wizard, finding relevant context"• PostgreSQL
  (vectordb) - "I'm the knowledge vault, holding RAG embeddings"
  • RAG API (rag_api) - "I'm the context retriever, connecting conversations to knowledge"
  • LibreChat API (LibreChat) - "I'm the conductor, orchestrating the whole show on port 3080"

  The Handshake Sequence:
  1. MongoDB wakes up → "Database ready for conversations"
  2. PostgreSQL starts → "Vector database ready for embeddings"
  3. RAG API connects → "Knowledge retrieval service online"
  4. MeiliSearch indexes → "Search capabilities activated"
  5. LibreChat API orchestrates → "Facility Management Assistant ready at localhost:3080"

  Implementation Steps

  # Navigate to LibreChat directory
  cd /services/librechat

  # Start the container orchestra
  docker compose up -d

  # Watch the services come alive (optional monitoring)
  docker compose logs -f

  System Boundary Handoff Protocol

  AI Completes (Programmatic Verification):
  • Service health checks: docker compose ps shows all 5 services "running"
  • Port binding verification: netstat -tulpn | grep 3080 shows port listening
  • Log analysis: Check for "Server listening on port 3080" in API logs
  • MCP connection status: Verify Bruce BEM server connectivity in logs

  → Human Tests (UI/Integration Elements):
  • Navigate to http://localhost:3080 in browser
  • Verify custom welcome message: "Welcome to Facility Management Assistant"
  • Check streamlined interface: No parameters/presets/prompts visible
  • Test Bruce BEM tools: Try asset search or work order creation
  • Confirm clean facility management experience

  → Expected Results:
  • Clean, simplified chat interface loads without technical clutter
  • Bruce BEM MCP tools available and functional
  • Facility management persona evident in welcome message

  ⎿ 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: LibreChat Startup & State Verification

    Investigation Findings: LibreChat infrastructure ready with 5-service Docker stack, UI partially
     streamlined, Bruce BEM MCP integrated

    Implementation Scope: Backend startup verification + UI handoff for current state assessment

    Git Safety Check: Not required - configuration management only

    Approach:
    1. Navigate to LibreChat directory (/services/librechat)
    2. Start Docker Compose services (docker compose up -d) 
    3. Verify all 5 services running via docker compose ps
    4. Check port 3080 binding and API startup logs
    5. Verify MCP server connectivity in logs
    6. Handoff to Human: UI testing at localhost:3080 for current state assessment

    Critical Path Alignment: Establishes working baseline for UI streamlining investigation

    Risk: None - read-only verification of existing working deployment

    Ready to implement startup verification with clear UI handoff protocol?

⏺ 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS

  What Was Implemented: LibreChat Docker stack startup with environment configuration

  Current Service Status:
  - ✅ 4/5 Services Running: MongoDB, MeiliSearch, RAG API, PostgreSQL all healthy
  - ❌ LibreChat API: Restarting due to permission error (EACCES - cannot create /app/logs/
  directory)
  - 🔧 Port 3080: Currently occupied by Code Helper process (PID 4429)

  Issues Discovered:
  1. Permission Error: LibreChat container cannot create log directories
  2. Port Conflict: Port 3080 already in use by existing Code Helper process
  3. UID/GID Configuration: Container permission mismatch needs resolution

  Next Steps: Fix permission issues and port conflicts before UI testing

  ---
  🚨 SYSTEM BOUNDARY HANDOFF

  AI Completes (Issues Found):
  • Service status: 4/5 services running, LibreChat API failing
  • Port conflict: 3080 occupied by Code Helper (PID 4429)• Permission error: /app/logs/ directory
  creation blocked
  • Docker build: Successful (image created: librechat-api)

  → Human Action Required Before UI Testing:
  • Stop Code Helper: Kill process on port 3080 or use different port
  • Fix Permissions: Update docker-compose volume mounts or UID/GID settings
  • Restart LibreChat: Once permission/port issues resolved

  → Expected After Fixes:
  • All 5 services showing "Up" status in docker compose ps
  • LibreChat accessible at http://localhost:3080
  • Custom "Facility Management Assistant" welcome message visible

⏺ 🎯 The Port Liberation & Container Revival Picture

  What I Understand

  • Port Hostage Situation: Code Helper (PID 4429) is squatting on port 3080 like a stubborn tenant
  • Permission Drama: LibreChat can't create /app/logs/ but you're right - this might be survivable
  • Container Orchestra: 4/5 services healthy, just need to free the conductor (LibreChat API)

  How I Envision The Solution

  The Port Liberation Mission:
  • Kill Command → "Code Helper, your time is up!" → Port 3080 becomes available
  • LibreChat Retry → "Finally, I can bind to my home port!" → Container resurrection
  • Graceful Degradation → "No logs directory? I'll write to console instead" → Smart fallback

  The Container Revival Sequence:
  1. Process assassination → Port 3080 liberated
  2. Container restart → LibreChat attempts revival
  3. Log fallback → App works despite permission constraints
  4. Service binding → "Server listening on port 3080"

  Implementation Steps

  # Execute the port liberation
  kill -9 4429

  # Restart the fallen container
  docker compose restart api

  # Watch the resurrection
  docker compose logs api -f --tail=10

  Why This Should Work:
  - Most Node.js apps gracefully handle log directory failures by falling back to console
  - LibreChat likely has logging fallbacks built-in
  - Port 3080 will be free for proper binding

  System Boundary Handoff Protocol

  AI Completes (Process & Container Management):
  • Process termination: kill -9 4429 → PID no longer exists
  • Container restart: docker compose restart api → New container instance
  • Port verification: lsof -i :3080 shows LibreChat binding• Log analysis: Check for "Server
  listening on port 3080" success message

  → Human Tests (UI Validation):
  • Navigate to http://localhost:3080
  • Verify LibreChat loads (may take 30-60 seconds for first startup)
  • Check custom welcome: "Welcome to Facility Management Assistant"
  • Confirm streamlined interface: No technical clutter visible

  → Expected Results:
  • Clean facility management chat interface
  • Custom welcome message displayed
  • MCP tools available for Bruce BEM integration

  ⎿ 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Port Liberation & LibreChat Revival

    Investigation Findings: Port 3080 blocked by Code Helper (PID 4429), LibreChat API failing on 
    log permissions

    Implementation Scope: Process termination + container restart + status verification

    Approach:
    1. Kill blocking process: kill -9 4429 (Code Helper on port 3080)
    2. Restart LibreChat API: docker compose restart api
    3. Monitor startup: docker compose logs api -f --tail=10
    4. Verify port binding: lsof -i :3080 shows LibreChat ownership
    5. Check service status: docker compose ps shows all services "Up"

    Critical Path Alignment: Removes blockers preventing UI testing of current streamlined state

    Permission Assessment: You're likely right - most Node.js apps handle log directory failures 
    gracefully with console fallback

    Risk: Minimal - killing user process + container restart, no permanent changes

> /first_principles is running… Can you let me know why? librechgat.yaml Is not being considered? Is it 
not attached in a volume? I think I do know the issue that dhccompose.overwrite is somehow not in this 
repository. Is it a git ignored? In my remote server I have it so I wonder why it wasn't pushed as well.

                                                conversation, I can identify these facts:\n1. We have a
                                                librechat.yaml file at
                                                `/services/librechat/librechat.yaml` that we successfully
                                                 read earlier\n2. The user mentions \"librechgat.yaml\"
                                                (typo) is not being considered\n3. User suspects
                                                docker-compose.override issue - mentions it's not in this
                                                 repo but exists on remote server\n4. User suspects it
                                                might be git ignored\n5. We found earlier that
                                                docker-compose.override.yml doesn't exist, only

                                                librechat.yaml contains interface simplifications and
                                                Bruce BEM MCP server config\n7. LibreChat is running and

⏺ What I assume might be true:

  Based strictly on our conversation:
  - The librechat.yaml file exists locally (we read it earlier) but isn't being loaded by LibreChat
  container
  - docker-compose.override.yml is missing from this repository (we only found .example version)
  - Volume mounting for librechat.yaml configuration isn't properly configured
  - The missing override file is needed to mount the config file into the container
  - This override file might be git ignored, explaining why it exists on your remote server but not
  locally

  What I'm explicitly uncertain about:

  - How LibreChat actually loads its configuration file (environment variable? default path?)
  - What's in the current .gitignore file regarding docker-compose files
  - Whether librechat.yaml is actually mounted and accessible inside the running container
  - What the actual LibreChat UI currently displays - are the custom interface settings being
  applied?
  - What volume mounts are currently active in the running LibreChat container

  Investigation Plan:

  ⎿ 🔍 INVESTIGATION PLAN

    Context: librechat.yaml exists locally but may not be loaded; docker-compose.override.yml 
    missing from repo but exists on remote

    Questions: 
    - Is librechat.yaml actually mounted in the running container?
    - What does .gitignore contain about docker-compose files?
    - How does LibreChat load configuration (CONFIG_PATH env var)?
    - Are the custom interface settings actually applied in the UI?
    - What volume mounts are currently active?

    Approach:
    1. Check .gitignore for docker-compose.override.yml patterns
    2. Inspect running container volume mounts (docker inspect LibreChat)
    3. Check if librechat.yaml is accessible inside container
    4. Verify CONFIG_PATH environment variable in container
    5. Compare docker-compose.yml vs override.yml.example for volume differences

    Sources: 
    - .gitignore file contents
    - Docker container inspection
    - Container filesystem (docker exec)
    - Environment variables inside container
    - Docker compose configuration files

    Expected Outcome: 
    - Confirm if config file mounting is missing
    - Identify if docker-compose.override.yml is git ignored
    - Understand how LibreChat loads configuration
    - Verify whether custom settings are actually being applied

⏺ 🔍 INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

  Investigated: Configuration file loading and volume mounting setup per planSources Checked:
  .gitignore, container volume mounts, container filesystem, docker-compose files

  Facts Discovered:

  ✅ Your Suspicion Was Correct:
  - docker-compose.override.yml is NOT git ignored - .gitignore only contains: .env, /assets/video,
  scripts/, .cache, temp/, __pycache__, .DS_Store
  - librechat.yaml is NOT mounted - Container volume mounts show only: logs, .env, images, uploads
  - No CONFIG_PATH environment variable - Container has no configuration path specified

  🔍 Root Cause Identified:
  - docker-compose.override.yml.example shows exactly what's needed on lines 28-31:
  api:
    volumes:
    - type: bind
      source: ./librechat.yaml
      target: /app/librechat.yaml

  📋 The Missing Piece:
  Your remote server likely has docker-compose.override.yml (not git ignored) containing the
  librechat.yaml volume mount, but this local repository is missing that file.

  Current State: LibreChat is running with default configuration - the custom interface settings and
  Bruce BEM MCP server are not being loaded.

  Next Steps: Create the missing docker-compose.override.yml with proper volume mounting to load your
   custom configuration.

> But does the remote repository have this file or not? That's what I'm not getting. Why is a remote

> Okay, so actually it was git-ignored. I pushed it to remote now, but I also already fixed it here. 
  Everything is working now.

  What exactly... We're now at the point where we have feature parity on the remote server in here. 
  It's probably stupid to do it here, but now at least we have it both for next time.

  I also copied over the environment row thing. The Libre chat is now mounted. According to the work 
  log, are we now at a current state and what exactly will be the next steps?

⏺ Looking at the work log from 2025-09-05 that we read earlier:

  Current State vs Work Log:

  ✅ Infrastructure Complete (as noted in work log):
  - LibreChat deployed with Bruce BEM MCP integration
  - Basic UI simplification done (6 elements disabled)
  - ✅ NEW: librechat.yaml now properly mounted (you just fixed this)

  What the Work Log Said Were Next Steps:

  "Next session: Focus on interface deep dive (investigate additional UI elements to disable) and 
  agent creation (system prompt configuration and auto-selection setup)"

  Work Log Reasoning:
  - Current state was "Vanilla LibreChat UI cleaned up and working with Bruce BEM MCP integration,
  but needs further interface investigation and agent creation for complete facility management
  workflow"

  So Where We Are Now:

  ✅ You've Achieved Feature Parity:
  - Local environment now matches remote server
  - librechat.yaml configuration is being loaded
  - Bruce BEM MCP integration active

  Next Steps (Per Work Log):

  1. Interface Deep Dive: Investigate additional UI elements that can be hidden for facility
  management users (beyond the 6 already disabled)
  2. Agent Creation:
    - System prompt configuration to create facility management persona
    - Auto-selection setup to eliminate MCP server selection from user workflow

  Available Resources from Work Log:
  - Interface configuration docs:
  https://www.librechat.ai/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface
  - GitHub Issue #5000 (agent auto-selection): https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/5000

  Ready to continue the UI streamlining investigation now that the foundation is properly configured?

> /first_principles is running… Let's begin with the interface. Look at the current configuration in 
LibreChat.yaml and let me know what else would be possible. Let's forget about the agent for now—let's 
only focus on the interface deep dive.

⏺ What I assume might be true:

  Based strictly on our conversation:
  - Current librechat.yaml has 8 interface settings (6 disabled, 1 enabled, 1 custom message)
  - modelSelect: true is still showing model selection (likely unwanted for facility management
  users)
  - Additional interface options exist beyond current config (webSearch, fileSearch, runCode
  mentioned in WebFetch)
  - More granular UI controls might be available that haven't been discovered yet
  - Some interface elements might have nested or advanced configuration options

  What I'm explicitly uncertain about:

  - The complete list of ALL available interface configuration options in LibreChat
  - What each interface option actually controls in the UI (detailed behavior)
  - Whether there are interface options specific to hiding MCP server selection
  - If there are additional options for customizing the chat interface appearance
  - Whether certain options have sub-configurations or dependencies

  Investigation Plan:

    Risk: None - UI-only changes, reversible by configuration

    Ready to implement complete facility management UI streamlining?

⏺ Investigation Complete!

  I've identified 5 additional interface options that can further streamline your facility management
   UI beyond what's currently configured. The most important finding: modelSelect should be false
  (it's currently true, still showing model selection).

  The complete recommended configuration would hide 13 UI elements total, creating a truly clean
  facility management interface with no technical clutter. Ready to implement these changes when you
  approve the plan above.

> /create-adr is running… Okay, let's create a simple ADR which is about. librechat interface Let's not 
even make it project-specific—let's just make it timeless because I'm pretty sure that if I deploy this 
again, I'm always gonna need this.

The main context is that I just want to have a very clean user interface—not for a power user but for a 
client, the user of the application. I mentioned what each of the interface actually does, in which cases
 we need it, I mean not in which case we need it but what it actually would give versus what it wouldn't.

⏺ 📋 ADR Preview & Validation

  Title: Configure LibreChat Interface for End-User Simplicity

  Context: LibreChat's default interface includes power-user features that overwhelm non-technical
  facility management users

  Decision: Disable all technical UI elements to create a clean, client-focused chat interface

  Consequences:
  - ✅ Non-technical users can focus on conversation without distraction
  - ✅ Reduced support requests from confused users
  - ✅ Professional appearance for client demonstrations
  - ❌ Power users lose quick access to advanced features
  - ❌ No ability to switch models or adjust parameters
  - ⚪ Configuration is reversible via YAML changes

  [ASSUMPTION CHECK]

  Based on our investigation, I'm working with these facts:

  • 13 interface options discovered: YES (from our research)
  • modelSelect should be false: YES (currently true, needs fixing)
  • Facility management context: YES (but making it generic per your request)
  • Each option's purpose documented: YES (from LibreChat docs research)
  • Client vs power user distinction: YES (you explicitly mentioned)

  Not Adding (wasn't mentioned):
  • Specific vendor names or integrations
  • Performance implications
  • Security considerations
  • Alternative UI frameworks

  Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with the full ADR documenting the clean interface
  configuration for end-users?

> Well, don't care about what we currently have. Just mention each interface option one by one.I said, 
  this is a timeless document, not a document for this project. I will use this universally for each 
  LibreChat deployment.

  Title: Configure LibreChat Interface for End-User Simplicity

  Context: LibreChat's default interface exposes technical features that overwhelm non-technical end
  users

  Decision: Systematically disable technical UI elements based on end-user vs power-user needs

  Consequences:
  - ✅ Clean, distraction-free interface for end users
  - ✅ Reduced cognitive load and training requirements
  - ✅ Professional client-facing appearance
  - ❌ Loss of flexibility for technical users
  - ❌ No on-the-fly model or parameter adjustments
  - ⚪ All changes reversible via configuration

  [ASSUMPTION CHECK]

  Based on our research, documenting these interface options:

  • All discovered LibreChat interface options: YES (from investigation)
  • What each option controls: YES (will document each one)
  • End-user vs power-user distinction: YES (your explicit requirement)
  • Timeless/universal approach: YES (not project-specific)

  Will Document:
  - Each interface option's purpose and impact
  - When to enable/disable for end-users vs power-users
  - Complete configuration examples

  Not Adding:
  - Current project state
  - Specific vendor integrations
  - Implementation timelines

  Should I proceed with the full ADR documenting each LibreChat interface option and its impact on
  end-user experience?

> Yes, that sounds good.

⏺ Architecture Decision Record: Configure LibreChat Interface for End-User Simplicity

  Status: AcceptedDate: 2025-09-08Deciders: Platform Architecture Team

  Context and Problem Statement

  LibreChat's default interface exposes numerous technical features designed for power users and
  developers. When deploying LibreChat for non-technical end users (customer service, facility
  management, healthcare staff), these features create confusion, increase training costs, and reduce
   adoption rates. A streamlined interface is needed that presents only essential chat functionality.

  Decision Drivers

  - User Experience: Non-technical users need simple, intuitive interfaces
  - Training Costs: Complex UIs require extensive onboarding
  - Support Burden: Technical options generate unnecessary support tickets
  - Professional Appearance: Client-facing deployments need clean presentation
  - Use Case Focus: Most deployments serve specific business functions, not general AI exploration

  Considered Options

  1. Full Feature Interface - Keep all LibreChat features visible
  2. Selective Hiding - Disable only the most technical features
  3. Minimal Interface - Hide all non-essential elements for pure chat experience
  4. Role-Based Interface - Different configurations per user type

  Decision Outcome

  Chosen option: "Minimal Interface" - systematically disable all technical UI elements for end-user
  deployments.

  Configure each interface option based on end-user needs rather than power-user capabilities.

  Consequences

  Positive

  - ✅ Reduced Cognitive Load: Users focus on conversation, not configuration
  - ✅ Faster Adoption: Minimal training required for basic chat interaction
  - ✅ Lower Support Costs: Fewer "what does this button do?" tickets
  - ✅ Professional Appearance: Clean interface suitable for client demonstrations
  - ✅ Predictable Behavior: No accidental model switches or parameter changes

  Negative

  - ❌ Limited Flexibility: Users cannot optimize for specific tasks
  - ❌ No Experimentation: Cannot test different models or approaches
  - ❌ Hidden Capabilities: Users unaware of system's full potential
  - ❌ One-Size-Fits-All: Same limitations for all users regardless of skill

  Neutral

  - ⚪ Reversible Changes: All settings modifiable via configuration file
  - ⚪ Per-Deployment Choice: Each installation can choose appropriate level
  - ⚪ Documentation Needed: Must explain to stakeholders why features are hidden

  Implementation Guidance

  1. Assess User Base: Determine technical proficiency of primary users
  2. Identify Core Workflows: Enable only features essential to business function
  3. Start Minimal: Begin with everything disabled, enable as needed
  4. Monitor Feedback: Track user requests for hidden features
  5. Document Decisions: Explain to users why interface is simplified

     # Architecture Decision Record: Configure LibreChat Interface for End-User Simplicity
     **Status:** Accepted
     **Date:** 2025-09-08
     **Deciders:** Platform Architecture Team
     ## Context and Problem Statement
     LibreChat's default interface exposes numerous technical features designed for power users and
     developers. When deploying LibreChat for non-technical end users (customer service, facility
     management, healthcare staff), these features create confusion, increase training costs, and
     reduce adoption rates. A streamlined interface is needed that presents only essential chat
     functionality.
